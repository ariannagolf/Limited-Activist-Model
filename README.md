# Examining the Limited Activist Model
## About

The study of political parties is essential to understanding the complex dynamics within a given
country’s political system. In this paper, we look at Rebecca A. Jeffs, John Hayward, Paul
A. Roach, and John Wyburn’s “Activist Model of Political Party Growth” which endeavors to
model the growth of a political party through word-of-mouth activism. The authors draw on
SIR models of epidemiology and previous studies of this technique applied to social diffusion
scenarios. To understand this model, we parse through the various actors, variables, and
assumptions that went into the creation of the model. We then analyze the authors’ results
and application of this model. Finally, we use a numerical solver to solve the equations and
reproduce the author’s graphs, adjusting optimized parameters to observe their effects on the
dynamical system.

## Methodologies 
We analyzed the specific effects various variables within the Limited Activist Model have on long term political party growth. Created visualizations demonstrating the effects of each variable.
